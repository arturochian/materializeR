# materializeR | materialize for R

[materialize](http://materializecss.com) implements Google's Material Design in a CSS/JS/HTML framework.  It is built by a talented [team of Carnegie Mellon Students](http://materializecss.com/about.html#team) and has amassed **> 8,000 stars** in less than half a year.  Although I have been watching it closely since its release, [abresler](http://asbcllc.com/) motivated this little `htmlwidget`.


### not a normal htmlwidget
Since `materialize` is a very full-featured and complete framework, the traditional full wrapping of an `htmlwidget` is nearly impossible.  For this reason, this `htmlwidget` seeks more to provide a thin convenience layer primarily aimed to ease dependency injection for the required Javascript and CSS.  What this means is that you will need to know some `HTML/JS/CSS` or copy/paste well to make it work.
